      <p>Hi, my name is Tynan and I am a software developer by trade but have many different interests including fishing, hunting, working out, football and learning lots of new topics.</p>
      <p>I currently work at a group home for kids but am spending my free time making better habits for myself to be able to get a job in my field. This is all thanks to the book <a href="atomichabits.com">Atomic Habits</a>. That book has changed my perspective on setting and accomplishing goals. If you are having trouble making positive changes in your life I highly recommend it.</p>
      <p>I have made this website as a way to keep myself accountable and to help keep my streak of studying and intentional learing everyday alive as long as possible.</p>
      <div class="wrapper">

          <h2>Goals 2024</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be a studious person as I will be attending University in the fall and want to make habits before I start.
            </li>
            <li>
              Workout 4 days a week while eating 4,100 calories a day to gain weight for football season
            </li>
            <li>
              Last but definetly not least to be passionate with my fianc√© because we made it a goal to start our first year of marriage in a passionate, unapologetic, maybe "cheesy", fun space.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>I am looking forward to this year and becoming a husband the amazing woman I get to call mine.</p>
